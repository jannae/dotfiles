# Jannae's Dotfiles

This is for my personal machines, and I tend to make things up (and break them) as I go along. Fair warning.

Now, after years of cherry-picking adding/removing tools and tweaks from my worflow, I finally see the value in open-sourcing and version controlling these files. So come in and critique my computer's underwear. It's for the best.

## First, the credit.

Bits and pieces come from all over. Special thanks to the major players, @mathiasbynens, @paulirish, @paulmillr, @s10wen, and @sindresorhus. 

## Set Up Files.

These run once, first thing, on a clean machine. I keep them maintained as I add/remove.

Set up Homebrew and add favorite binaries:

    ./setup/binaries.sh

Set up [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) and install favorite Apps:

    ./setup/apps.sh

Set up OSX. Almost entirely stolen from [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) famous [.osx](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx).

	./setup/osx.sh
